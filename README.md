This is application of MasterMind game implemented by Jave.

By default, it creates a secret code of 4 digits. Each digit must be between 1 and 6. The code breaker (user) gets 12 chances to guess the code. The user can set these paramenters when entering the game.

The code breaker will enter their guess at the command line when prompted (ex: 1234). 

The application will then respond with some number of +’s and -’s where the +’s are always printed before the -’s. 

- If the code breaker guesses correctly, the program prints “You solved it!”. 
- If the code breaker runs out of tries, the program prints “You lose :(“
